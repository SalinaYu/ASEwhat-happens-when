# HTTP protocol

If the web browser used was written by Google, instead of sending an HTTP request to retrieve the page, it will send a request to try and negotiate with the server an "upgrade" from HTTP to the SPDY protocol.

If the client is using the HTTP protocol and does not support SPDY, it sends a request to the server of the form:

```html
    GET / HTTP/1.1
    Host: google.com
    Connection: close
    [other headers]
```

where ``[other headers]`` refers to a series of colon-separated key-value pairs formatted as per the HTTP specification and separated by single new lines.
(This assumes the web browser being used doesn't have any bugs violating the HTTP spec. This also assumes that the web browser is using ``HTTP/1.1``, otherwise it may not include the ``Host`` header in the request and the version specified in the ``GET`` request will either be ``HTTP/1.0`` or ``HTTP/0.9``.)

HTTP/1.1 defines the "close" connection option for the sender to signal that
the connection will be closed after completion of the response. For example,

```html
    Connection: close
```

HTTP/1.1 applications that do not support persistent connections MUST include the "close" connection option in every message.

After sending the request and headers, the web browser sends a single blank newline to the server indicating that the content of the request is done.

The server responds with a response code denoting the status of the request and responds with a response of the form:

```html
    200 OK
    [response headers]
```

Followed by a single newline, and then sends a payload of the HTML content of ``www.google.com``. The server may then either close the connection, or if headers sent by the client requested it, keep the connection open to be reused for further requests.

If the HTTP headers sent by the web browser included sufficient information for the web server to determine if the version of the file cached by the web browser has been unmodified since the last retrieval (ie. if the web browser included an ``ETag`` header), it may instead respond with a request of the form::

```html
    304 Not Modified
    [response headers]
```

and no payload, and the web browser instead retrieves the HTML from its cache.

After parsing the HTML, the web browser (and server) repeats this process for every resource (image, CSS, favicon.ico, etc) referenced by the HTML page, except instead of ``GET / HTTP/1.1`` the request will be
``GET /$(URL relative to www.google.com) HTTP/1.1``.

If the HTML referenced a resource on a different domain than ``www.google.com``, the web browser goes back to the steps involved in resolving the other domain, and follows all steps up to this point for that domain. The ``Host`` header in the request will be set to the appropriate server name instead of ``google.com``.
