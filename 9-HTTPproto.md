# HTTP protocol

If the web browser used was written by Google, instead of sending an HTTP request to retrieve the page, it will send a request to try and negotiate with the server an "upgrade" from HTTP to the SPDY protocol.

If the client is using the HTTP protocol and does not support SPDY, it sends a
request to the server of the form::

    GET / HTTP/1.1
    Host: google.com
    Connection: close
    [other headers]

where ``[other headers]`` refers to a series of colon-separated key-value pairs
formatted as per the HTTP specification and separated by single new lines.
(This assumes the web browser being used doesn't have any bugs violating the
HTTP spec. This also assumes that the web browser is using ``HTTP/1.1``,
otherwise it may not include the ``Host`` header in the request and the version
specified in the ``GET`` request will either be ``HTTP/1.0`` or ``HTTP/0.9``.)

HTTP/1.1 defines the "close" connection option for the sender to signal that
the connection will be closed after completion of the response. For example,

    Connection: close

HTTP/1.1 applications that do not support persistent connections MUST include
the "close" connection option in every message.

After sending the request and headers, the web browser sends a single blank
newline to the server indicating that the content of the request is done.

The server responds with a response code denoting the status of the request and
responds with a response of the form::

    200 OK
    [response headers]

Followed by a single newline, and then sends a payload of the HTML content of
``www.google.com``. The server may then either close the connection, or if
headers sent by the client requested it, keep the connection open to be reused
for further requests.

If the HTTP headers sent by the web browser included sufficient information for
the web server to determine if the version of the file cached by the web
browser has been unmodified since the last retrieval (ie. if the web browser
included an ``ETag`` header), it may instead respond with a request of
the form::

    304 Not Modified
    [response headers]

and no payload, and the web browser instead retrieves the HTML from its cache.

After parsing the HTML, the web browser (and server) repeats this process
for every resource (image, CSS, favicon.ico, etc) referenced by the HTML page,
except instead of ``GET / HTTP/1.1`` the request will be
``GET /$(URL relative to www.google.com) HTTP/1.1``.

If the HTML referenced a resource on a different domain than
``www.google.com``, the web browser goes back to the steps involved in
resolving the other domain, and follows all steps up to this point for that
domain. The ``Host`` header in the request will be set to the appropriate
server name instead of ``google.com``.
