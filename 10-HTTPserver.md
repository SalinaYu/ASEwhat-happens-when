# HTTP Server Request Handle

The HTTPD (HTTP Daemon) server is the one handling the requests/responses on the server side. The most common HTTPD servers are Apache or nginx for Linux and IIS for Windows.

* The HTTPD (HTTP Daemon) receives the request.
* The server breaks down the request to the following parameters:
   * HTTP Request Method (either ``GET``, ``HEAD``, ``POST``, ``PUT``,
     ``DELETE``, ``CONNECT``, ``OPTIONS``, or ``TRACE``). In the case of a URL
     entered directly into the address bar, this will be ``GET``.
   * Domain, in this case - google.com.
   * Requested path/page, in this case - / (as no specific path/page was
     requested, / is the default path).
* The server verifies that there is a Virtual Host configured on the server
  that corresponds with google.com.
* The server verifies that google.com can accept GET requests.
* The server verifies that the client is allowed to use this method
  (by IP, authentication, etc.).
* If the server has a rewrite module installed (like mod_rewrite for Apache or
  URL Rewrite for IIS), it tries to match the request against one of the
  configured rules. If a matching rule is found, the server uses that rule to
  rewrite the request.
* The server goes to pull the content that corresponds with the request,
  in our case it will fall back to the index file, as "/" is the main file
  (some cases can override this, but this is the most common method).
* The server parses the file according to the handler. If Google
  is running on PHP, the server uses PHP to interpret the index file, and
  streams the output to the client.
